# ChessTCG
A chess card game

Each player starts with 16 generic pieces that can't do anything, and 4 cards in their hand.
At the start of each player's turn, they draw a card and gain 1 maximum mana.
At any point in the turn, they can use one of their cards to "transform" one of the generic pieces into the piece on the card.
Moving a piece cost 1 mana and can only be done 1 time each turn unless the piece is transformed.
