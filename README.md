# ChessTCG
A chess card game

Each player starts with 15 generic pieces that can't do anything, a king, and 3 cards in their hand.
At the start of each player's turn, they draw a card and move a piece.
At any point in the turn, they can use one of their cards to "transform" one of the generic pieces into the piece on the card.
