# ChessTCG
A chess card game

Each player starts with 16 generic pieces that can't do anything, and 4 cards in their hand.
At the start of each player's turn, they draw a card and gain 1 maximum mana.
At any point in the turn, they can use one of their cards to "transform" one of the generic pieces into the piece on the card.
They must pay mana equal to 1 + the number of times the piece has been moved that turn.
